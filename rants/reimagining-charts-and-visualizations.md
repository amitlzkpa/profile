# Reimagining Charts and Visualizations: Balancing Purism and Communication

## Introduction:

Charts and visualizations are powerful tools for conveying complex information in a concise and accessible manner. However, when it comes to creating technical diagrams, we often find ourselves stuck between two conflicting approaches. On one side, there's a desire to maintain purism, using standard sizes and shapes while avoiding bias. On the other side, there's a need to enhance readability and understandability, even if it means sacrificing some of the purist ideals. In this article, we'll delve into the reasons behind our conventional charting practices and explore the potential benefits of breaking free from the monotonous and drab patterns.

## The Purpose of Charts: Ideals of Publishing Purism or Communication?

Charts serve a twofold purpose: to uphold ideals of publishing purism and to serve as a means of communication. Let's take a closer look at both aspects:

Upholding Ideals of Publishing Purism:
Traditionally, adhering to specific chart formats and avoiding bias has been seen as essential for maintaining objectivity in data representation. Standardized charts are often deemed more credible and trustworthy, especially in scientific and technical contexts. By following rigid guidelines, we aim to present information as objectively as possible, eliminating potential misinterpretations.

Serving as a Means of Communication:
Beyond their purist intentions, charts are meant to be tools of communication. Effective data visualization allows information to be quickly understood and absorbed, enhancing the audience's engagement and comprehension. By adding creativity and imagination to charting, we can go beyond conveying data and express ideas, concepts, and emotions more deeply.

## The Movie Dilemma: Applying Creativity to Charting

Drawing a parallel to the movie industry, we find a similar dilemma. Some movies strictly adhere to realism, portraying stories as close to life as possible, but they risk becoming dry and unremarkable. On the other hand, creative movies can convey emotions and messages more effectively, capturing the audience's attention and leaving a lasting impact. The same can be said for charting: straying from strict rules and embracing creativity can make data more compelling and memorable.

## Revisiting "Excel Charts" and Infrastructural Representation:

Standardized charts, often reminiscent of Excel graphs, may not be the most effective way to represent complex systems, especially when depicting large infrastructure or novel concepts. When trying to visualize a small piece of infrastructure, a minimalist approach may omit vital details, leaving readers perplexed. Conversely, using generic shapes and sizes for significant structures can lead to information overload and confusion.

## Empowering Newcomers through Enhanced Visuals:

An essential aspect of charting is considering the audience, particularly those new to the subject matter. Utilizing creative elements in visualizations can make concepts more accessible and intuitive for newcomers, enabling them to grasp the underlying information quickly. Engaging charts can spark curiosity and encourage further exploration, nurturing a deeper understanding of the topic.

## Conclusion:

As we navigate the world of charting and data visualization, it's crucial to strike a balance between adhering to purist ideals and enhancing communication. While standardized charts have their place in maintaining objectivity, infusing creativity into visualizations can elevate the impact of our message and make complex information more engaging and memorable. Let's challenge the notion of traditional "Excel charts" and explore innovative ways to represent data, ensuring that our charts not only inform but also inspire and captivate their audience. By embracing creativity, we can revolutionize the way we communicate ideas, leaving a lasting impression on those who interact with our visualizations.
